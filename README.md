
# Building Simple Neural Network

## Problem Statement

In this lab, we builded neural networs with Sigmoid, Exponenial ReLU, ReLU and Tanh activation function from scratch and code how it performs predictions using forward propagation. After doing forward propagation, we are going to use backpropagation.


## How to Run Code

Before running the code make sure that you have these libraries:

 - matplotlib
 - numpy
