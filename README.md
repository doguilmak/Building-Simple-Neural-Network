
# Building Simple Neural Network

## Problem Statement

In this lab, we will build a neural network with sigmoid function from scratch and code how it performs predictions using forward propagation. After doing forward propagation, we are going to use backpropagation. All details are in **Forward_and_Back_Propagation_ANN.ipynb** file.


## How to Run Code

Before running the code make sure that you have these libraries:

 - matplotlib
 - numpy
 - IPython
